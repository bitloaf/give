Give
====

Donate to your favorite charities with the tap of a button!

The idea
--------
You get a list of charitable organizations, and you can donate to them directly
through the app (PayPal, Google Wallet, etc). The idea is simple; The easier it
is to donate money, the more likely people are willing to do so. Also, by
integrating the donations with Facebook/Twitter, people can share their
contributions, and give an extra incentive for other people to donate as well.

You can also enable ads in the app, which generates revenue to the app itself,
which can cover necessities like server hosting, and where the proceeds can go
to a list of causes, voted by the users. So you can help without donating your
own money!

If there are certain larger events (natural disasters, fundraisers, etc), you
can receive a push notification with information on how to help.

Contributions

All contributions are welcome, little or small! Whether it is your development
effort, finding new causes, content moderation, contributing to the
